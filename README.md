# keycloak-performance-scripts


We used three different tools to evaluate the performance behavior of some of
the main Keycloak API endpoints. The tools are:

* [Hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)
* [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
* [WRT](https://github.com/wg/wrk)

We suggest to use Vegeta although the other tools can provide some metrics that
are missing in Vegeta.

Note: you can also find some scripts used to test endpoints, generate reports
or to obtain offline tokens.
